# XingTool 工具包

#### Description
The Java toolkit produced by XingTian is based on Springboot. It is an integrated starter that integrates various tool classes. In the basic package, many tool classes are provided, integrating the common toolkits of giants such as Ruoyi and ican, which is an extension of hutool (because it comes with hutool tools). In the autoconfigure package, some AOP and auto assembled classes are provided, which can be enabled through configuration files (for easy injection) or manually injected into beans.
